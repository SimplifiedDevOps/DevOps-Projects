Steps to Restore EC2 Volume

To recover the latest working state of the EC2 instance by creating new volume from the snapshot. 
Attach the new volume to the EC2 instance.


import boto3
import itemgetter from operator
Add ec2_client & ec2_resource
hardcode the instance_id
get the list of volumes
use the latest volume using volumes['Volumes'][0]
get the snapshots of the volume using volume id
do the sorting to get the latest snapshot through itemgetter.
create a new volume of the latest snapshot.
attach volume to the ec2 instance.

We may get error when calling the Attachvolume operation: vol-xxxxxxxxx is not available.  
This may occur due to the volume is still in creation state. This is the timing issue.

To fix the timing issue we can use while loop untill the volume state is Available.
when in infinite loop, break the loop.
